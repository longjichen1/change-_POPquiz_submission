#Change++ Project: POPQuiz

This app is made with RESTful API. To start the app, make sure to run ```node index.js``` (or wherever index.js is accessible) to start API.

Project is made using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS. JS handles the functionality of the webapp including buttons and updated songs/artists/images.

Webscraping script was updated to support a more robust Json model, main.js code should be updated shortly. 

Future updates to resolve and fine-tune webapp include color-responsive choice containers to display incorrect and correct song rankings, live audio files (using Spotify API key as YouTube Embeds are now against TOS), and a more mobile-friendly interface.
